🏭 Industrial Copper Modeling Project
📌 Project Overview

The copper industry plays a crucial role in manufacturing, energy,
and construction. However, pricing and sales forecasting are often challenging due to skewed data,
noise, and inconsistent patterns. Traditional manual analysis is slow and prone to errors.

This project applies Machine Learning (ML) techniques to model and predict copper sales and pricing trends.
By leveraging advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, 
the solution helps improve decision-making, demand forecasting, and pricing strategy in the industrial copper domain.

🎯 Problem Statement

Copper sales and pricing data are often skewed and contain outliers/noise.

Manual predictions are time-consuming and less accurate.

Business stakeholders need a robust ML solution to optimize decision-making.

Goal: Build and evaluate a machine learning regression model that predicts copper pricing/sales with improved accuracy.
